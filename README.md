# PITANKGO_1: University project for Digital Systems Course

PiTankGo is a electronic toy based on a program implemented on C and executed in a Raspberry Pi. You have a infrared light "gun" and you can controll it in two ways:

-With a numeric keyboard (ISR)
-With an accelerometer. The info given by this sensor is translated A/D using an Arduino mega 2560 and transmited to the Raspi by USB

The toy has a infrared detector and it detects if you hit the mark. All supported with sound effects.
For helping the user pointing, the toy has a camera and streams video in a local server. We have created an Android app to connect to this server and watch the streaming.
